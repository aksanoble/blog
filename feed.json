            "content_html": "<p>We're running a program called <a href=\"https://propel.school\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">propel.school</a> which is a 2 week free program to get started with learning how to code. 2 weeks is a very short duration to be able to turn you into a coder but it's a start. Our goal from the program is to give you a <em>taste </em>for programming and give you exposure on next steps for learning web development and how to start applying for jobs. </p>\n<p>One of the main tasks that people do during the 2 weeks is work towards getting their <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Basic Data Stucture and Algorithms Certification on FreeCodeCamp</a>. Recently one of our mentors told me that the FreeCodeCamp website was down. That they were upgrading their curriculum and it would probably take 2 days to be able to bring it back up. Something about that statement was weird. Although I was excited about a new project based curriclum 2 days seemed like an awful long time for the transition.</p>\n<p>On closer look I found out <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-servers-update-october-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">what the heck was going on FreeCodeCamp servers</a>. It was heartening the extraordinary level of commitment when Quincy assures us that FCC will never go down. Even if it means </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> I would go get some other job and pay for the servers myself.</p>\n<p>- Quincy Larson</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This makes me wonder if FreeCodeCamp has to be a web based service that needs to be accessed from the same central servers. Can FreeCodeCamp be hosted on something like <a href=\"https://ipfs.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IPFS</a>? While we think on how we can make FreeCodeCamp work offline there is a different interpretation for offline FCC that I am excited about. </p>\n<p>A dedicated physical <em>offline </em>space for people to come and work on FreeCodeCamp and learn programming. That's what <a href=\"https://propel.school\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">propel.school</a> is all about. We're looking to start a dedicated space for this. </p>\n<p>More updates soon...</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
