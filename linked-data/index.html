The current web is a giant word document. We need platforms to make it more excel like.</strong></p><p><strong>Excel Word</strong><br><br>You remember the attendance registers in the 'Old School'. Everyday teachers in my school would have to 'mark' attendance of all students in the register. <br><br>Let's imagine for a moment that instead of 'marking' they 'logged' the attendance in good-ole sentences. </p><p>- Shreyas was present on 17 July 1999 Morning session<br>- Ashish was present on 17 July 1999 Morning session<br>- Shashi was present  on 17 July 1999 Afternoon session<br>...<br><br>Good luck counting and keeping tabs on the number of holidays taken by each student at the end of the month.<br><br>The good part is that no one takes attendance this way. We have specialised books with neatly laid out rows and columns, there were also times when teachers would hand-draw these grids for each date with a long ruler and red ink. Thanks to these organised grids, counting now would be a trivial and short exercise. There could be orders of magnitude of difference in time and effort needed to derive the same insights purely based on how we represent ideas and information. <br><br>What got unlocked when people transitioned from representing numbers from characters a.k.a Roman Numerals such as M, X, V, I to symbols such as 1000, 10, 5, 1? We then turned around to represent numbers with alphabet notations leading to the birth of algebra. <br><br>Did the representation of numbers on a line lead to the birth of calculus? </p><p>One cannot overstate the importance of how we represent our ideas and knowledge. <br>Don't take my word for it. Here's the overly quote from Einstein</p><blockquote><p><br>“We owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to count, without which no worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made.”<br>Albert Einstein</p></blockquote><p>How we represent ideas determines what we can do with them and what evolves from it.<br><br><strong>WORD Wide Web</strong><br><br>One of the reasons why people are spending countless hours doing 'research' online is because we are trying to glean structured data out of soupy text in a giant document consisting of billions of pages.<br><br>It's like the teacher from school running a query<br><br>"Number of days Akshay was present this October" only to get the search snippet</p><p class="msg msg--highlight"> "Akshay was absent on Wednesday"</p><p>Which links to the full log of everyone's attendance. <br><br>While full prose style sentences are good for storytelling they aren't the best for capturing attendance and they definitely aren't the best tool for publishing all information on the web. </p><p>In an ideal world when I'm looking for a coworking space in Bengaluru, what I want to see is a comprehensive list of coworking spaces with filters for prices, locations, and recommendations from friends.

In Apr 2021 I built a small <a href="https://listtweet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tool</a> that allows one to make twitter lists automatically.

Credit: https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-db-vs-rdbms/</figcaption></figure><p>The advantage of the graph structure is the modelling flexibility and extensibility. We can arbitrarily connect each node to any other node via different types of relationships. This is the fundamental idea behind the semantic web. <br><br>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has published standards to agree and interoperate on how to publish data structured as graphs on the open web. </p><p>Despite being in development for more than 25 years the semantic web hasn't really taken off. <a href="https://terminusdb.com/blog/the-semantic-web-is-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Much</a> has been said about why the semantic web hasn't really taken off.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">At the heart of it  web applications that facilitate creating structured content on the internet have no incentives to share the hard collected data on the open web in an interoperable standard.</p><p>Especially when the entire point of the business is to lock that data down and not share it at all costs. <br><br>But accessible organised knowledge about the world is <a href="https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/encouraging-research-open-knowledge-networks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paramount</a>. We can even set a price to it. The asking rate is about <a href="https://www.diffbot.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300$ for about 10,000 things</a>.  <br><br>Another consequence of organised information not being accessible is the enormous cost of discoverability on the web. In 2022 for the first time ever world wide online ad spend is set to cross $600B. </p><p>The extent of information organised in the world should be measured by the reduction in global ad spend. Global ad spend is a sort of tax for discovery. We need to find avenues of reducing this burden. My current thesis is that access to knowledge commons combined with the information of who has published the information and how we know them can help significantly in discoverability both from the perspective of people looking for answers and entities looking to be discovered. </p><p><strong>Decentralised dilemma </strong></p><p>The W3C approach of standards is on the assumption that people self-publish their data. But as a world we aren't there yet. It's the same reason why we use gmail despite email being an open protocol. We still continue to use Twitter despite ActivityPub. People aren't managing their own servers on their own terms. It's just easier to use centralised services and get the job done. The incentives are also aligned for organisations to build such centralised platforms. For now. </p><p>Are there centralised platforms to organise all human knowledge? There are!</p><p>One of the earliest projects in this space was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebase_(database)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freebase</a>.  Freebase got acquired by Google and was eventually shut down. Freebase at Google evolved to be the Google Knowledge Graph. The data and the crowdsourcing part of freebase currently exists as <a href="http://wikidata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wikidata</a>. </p><p>The problem with Wikidata is the same as that on Wikipedia. You and I aren't on it. Your dog doesn't have a wikipedia page (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_corgis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unless you're the queen</a>) and would be taken down if you were to create one. The problem is of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>. It's a place only for <em>notable</em> things. </p><p>We don't just need a knowledge base for notable things, we need one for everything. You should be able add yourself or your local grocery store to a public common database for everyone to use. </p><p>There are other approaches where we structure information for certain verticals. For <a href="https://zomato.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">food</a>, <a href="https://magicpin.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retail outlets</a>, <a href="https://tracxn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">startups and investments</a>, <a href="https://alternativeto.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saas products</a>. But each of these platforms is another silo. The data is neither part of the commons nor allows one to interlink to other things. <br><br>We need centralised platforms to structure all human knowledge and make it accessible. <br><br><a href="https://golden.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden</a> is pursuing this goal. They're also exploring incentivising contributions from everyone through <a href="https://golden.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tokens</a>. <br><br>Needless to say, this is a very exciting space for me. Last month I started working on a proof of concept (<a href="https://crowww.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://crowww.in</a>) for a crowdsourced knowledge graph. <br><br>As a starting point I've indexed the 'Ecological Wealth' database curated by Ganeshram from Rainmatter Foundation. You can currently look up 37k+ entities and 140,000+ relationships related to ecology in India.</p><p>You can also view the entire data <a href="https://ecologicalwealth.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on this massive Airtable base</a>. <br><br>Would love to hear your thoughts on this!</p><blockquote><p>“Eventually everything connects - people, ideas, objects.<br>The quality of the connections is the key to quality per se."<br>Charles Eames</p></blockquote><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 23, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://kanthi.io/tags/diffbot/">diffbot</a></li><li><a href="https://kanthi.io/tags/goldencom/">golden.com</a></li><li><a href="https://kanthi.io/tags/knowledge-graphs/">knowledge graphs</a></li><li><a href="https://kanthi.io/tags/linked-data/">linked-data</a></li><li><a href="https://kanthi.io/tags/semantic-web/">semantic web</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fkanthi.io%2Flinked-data%2F" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kanthi.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkanthi.io%2Flinked-data%2F&amp;via=aksanoble&amp;text=Linked%20data" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://kanthi.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://kanthi.io/authors/akshay-kanthi/" class="invert" rel="author">Akshay Kanthi</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kanthi.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://kanthi.io/tech-by-the-lake/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Tech by the lake</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://kanthi.io/baserow-self-hosting/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Baserow self hosting </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kanthi.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/aksanoble" aria-label="Twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://kanthi.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Publii Static CMS</a> <br>Get in touch akshay@kanthi.io</div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://kanthi.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
